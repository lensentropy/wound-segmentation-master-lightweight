#Abstract
This project constructed a deep learning-based medical image semantic segmentation system for automatic recognition and extraction of clinical wound regions. Implementation based on TensorFlow 2.x. It's a Fully automatic wound
segmentation with deep
Lightweight modification of convolutional neural networks model in this paper. iGEM hardware project that will be used for OUC-Haide
